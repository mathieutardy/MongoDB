Description of the database:
There are two collections in the database called movielens_movies and movielens_users.

movielens_users collects information about the user (id, name, gender, occupation). There is also a link to a nested document which lists all the rated movies of the associated user. This document holds the rating, the id of the movie and the timestamp at which the movie was rated.

movielens_movies is a collection of movies. The available attributes are the id, the title and genres of the movie.

We can make link between the two collections by joining on the id of the movies.
